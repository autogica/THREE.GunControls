TODO

Should we use gyronorm.js?

I fear that we would need to modify it to add values instead or storing snapshots
(ie. to take successive updates or acceleration, instead of only taking the
  latest into account)


Add an edit mode

In edit mode it should be possible to drag buttons to re-arrange the layout
